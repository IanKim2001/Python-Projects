# Projects Description 
[(1) Bank Telemarketing Data Classification Project](https://github.com/PAKARALO/Python-Projects/tree/7a3fa5a382ca5654a8749edcfb1b716833fa9783/Bank%20telemarketing%20data%20classification%20project)

This project involves creating classification models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forests, to identify potential customers likely to subscribe to bank deposits. Through these models, the project aims to uncover key features influencing classification decisions. The goal is to provide insights that can guide banks in optimizing telemarketing efforts by targeting customers more likely to meet subscription criteria. The project is divided into the following three sections: 
- [Part1. Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/PAKARALO/Python-Projects/blob/d1e3a72b42a7f7bce2ce72d549f27345c07fe1df/Bank%20telemarketing%20data%20classification%20project/Part1.%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
- [Part2. Data Pre-processing](https://github.com/PAKARALO/Python-Projects/blob/d1e3a72b42a7f7bce2ce72d549f27345c07fe1df/Bank%20telemarketing%20data%20classification%20project/Part2.%20Data%20pre-preprocessing.ipynb)
- [Part3. Model Development](https://github.com/PAKARALO/Python-Projects/blob/d1e3a72b42a7f7bce2ce72d549f27345c07fe1df/Bank%20telemarketing%20data%20classification%20project/Part3.%20Model%20Development.ipynb)
